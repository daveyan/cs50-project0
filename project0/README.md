A) Contents of index.html

1. An unordered list of navigation links using bootstraps navbar (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/)

2. An image of an adorable dog. (dog.jpg)

B) Contents of pageone.html

1. The same unordered list from A1.

2. Four bootstrap cards (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/) with an image (card1-4.png), a title, and button link to the video on Youtube. These cards use the bootstrap grid columns to dynamically resize based on the size of the window.

C) Contents of pagetwo.html

1. The same unordered list from A1

2. A list of the reasons why the dogs are awesome.

D) Content of pagethree.html

1. The same unordered list from A1

2. A table using the bootstrap table (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/tables/) that recommends whether not a user should get a particular breed of dog. The answer is obviously yes.

E) Contents of pagefour.html

1. The same unordered list from A1

2. A button linking cat lovers to a video on Youtube. It's a video that "won't let you down". (Joke page)


Other things to note:

There are some less than ideal coding aspects since HTML is not a computational language. Things like the navigation title are added programmatically using SASS variables; this was done in order populate things (such as the nav titles) across multiple html files without manually editing each file.

"pageone.html" and "pagethree.html" contain the grid layout requirements. 

There is a media query that changes the background of color depending on the size of the browser.

All of the CSS properties and selectors have been labled in the SASS file.
